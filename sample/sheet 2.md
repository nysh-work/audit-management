	The determination of materiality by an auditor involves the following steps:
°	Step 1: Assessing the risk of material misstatements (RoMM).
°	Step 2: Choosing the appropriate benchmark.
°	Step 3: Determining a level (usually a percentage) of this benchmark.
°	Step 4: Documenting the choice with proper justification.
	
Step 1: Assessing the risk of material misstatements.	
-	The first consideration in calculating the materiality at the planning stage is to the assess the risk associated with the business. 
-	There is inverse relationship between risk and materiality. The higher the assessed risk of material misstatement within the financial statements, the lower the materiality and vice versa. 
-	The assessment of the risk level of the engagement depends on multiple considerations and is based on professional judgment of the auditor. Accordingly, the auditor may choose the level of risk associated with each of the consideration / add other considerations.  
-	If the materiality is too high, the auditor may not perform additional audit procedures or if it is too low, the auditor may perform more additional procedures, than that is necessary.
	
Step 2: Choosing the appropriate benchmark.	
-	Determining Materiality is based on two key aspects - Relevant benchmarks and the type of the entity for which materiality is required to be determined.  
-	Benchmarks:
	The following benchmarks can be chosen based upon the types of entities (Para A2 of SA 320):
·	a) Total Revenue 
·	b) Total Assets 
·	c) Net Profit or normalized (adjusted) PBT 
·	d) Total Expenses
·	e) Total Equity 
-	Types of Entities
	a) Profit Oriented: The entity which is commercial entity/ formed with the main objective of earning profits.  
	b) Not for Profit: The entity which is formed with different objective other than earning profits.
	C) Debt Financed: The entity majorly financed through debt funds.
	d) Volatility in Profit: Entities which face Volatility in profits.  In such cases, normalized profit before tax from continuing operations may be used in case of exceptional increase/decrease in profits.
	e) Liquidity: The entity facing liquidity crises.
	f) Entities Executing Public Utility Project/ Program: Central/State governments and related government entities (for example, agencies, boards, commissions). 
	
Applying Benchmarks based on Entity Types	
-	Benchmarks based on entity type can be considered to be applied as under 
-	a) Profit Oriented: The entity which is commercial entity/ formed with the main objective of earning profits.  (Para A4 of SA 320)
	Benchmark(s)
	Net Profit before Tax or normalized (or adjusted) profit before tax from continuing operations figure based on past results
-	b) Not for Profit: The entity which is formed with different objective other than earning profits. (Para A6 of SA 320)
	Benchmark(s)
	i) Total Revenue
	ii) Total Expense
-	C) Debt Financed: The entity majorly financed through debt funds. (Para A2 of SA 320)
	Benchmark(s)
	Net Asset Value
-	d) Volatility in Profit: Normalized profit before tax from continuing operations may be used in case of exceptional increase/decrease in profits. (Para A3 of SA 320)
	Benchmark(s)
	i) Total Revenue
	ii) Gross Profits
-	e) Liquidity: The entity facing liquidity crises.
	Benchmark(s)
	Total Equity
-	f) Entities Executing Public Utility Project/ Program: Central/State governments and related government entities (for example, agencies, boards, commissions). (Para A8- A9 of SA 320)
	Benchmark:
	i) Total Cost
	ii) Net Cost
	iii) Assets
	
Step 3: Determining a level (usually a percentage) of this benchmark.	
-	Once the entity types and the benchmarks are cognized for, it is now relevant to identify percentages relevant for the determination of materiality 
-	There are a number of benchmarks which can be selected  to help calculate materiality and a range of materiality percentages that could be used when calculating materiality. 
-	SA 320 doesn't  specifically mention the ranges of percentages that can be used as again this is left to the Auditor's Professional Judgement, however, common percentages used are given below. Ideally the one selected by the auditor should be the benchmark that most represents the needs of the users of financial statements. Examples of common percentages based on benchmarks are as follows:
	a) Total Revenue (0.5% to 1%)
	b) Total Assets (1% to 2%)
	c) Net Profit or normalized (adjusted) PBT (5% to 10%)
	d) Total Expenses (0.5% to 1%)
	e) Total Equity (2% to 5%)
-	If assessed risk is high then the lower percentages for calculating materiality will be selected. If assessed risk is low then the higher percentages will be used.
-	Indeed there may also be separate balances and classes of transactions that require a much lower materiality figure to be used than the one calculated for the financial statements as a whole, since misstatements of a lesser amount than materiality in these particular balances or classes of transactions could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users.
-	For less/ more than 12 month Financial Statement period, materiality relates to whole of that period. (Para A5 of SA 320)
-	The determination of performance materiality is not a simple mechanical calculation and involves the exercise of professional judgement. It is affected by the auditor's understanding of the entity, updated during the performance of the risk assessment procedures and the nature & extent of misstatements identified in previous audits and thereby the auditor's expectations in relation to misstatements in the current period. in general, many auditors are using 50% to 90% of materiality as reasonable estimates of performance materiality. When looking at the schedule of unadjusted errors, the aggregate of this will be compared with the performance materiality figure to decide whether the financial statements require further adjustment. 
-	Some of the factors that can be used to determine the percentage are placed below 
·	 New Engagement 
·	 Startup Entity 
·	 Significant concerns identified at client acceptance/ continuing. 
·	 Doubt on integrity of management 
·	 Concerns about operating effectiveness of controls 
·	 Effectiveness of Internal Audit Function 
·	 Ongoing investigations 
·	 Negative publicity 
·	 Complexity in operations, organization structure and products 
·	 Significant changes in economic accounting & regulatory environment. 
·	 Going-concern and liquidity issues including loss of significant customers 
·	 Operating losses making the threat of bankruptcy 
·	 Installation of significant new IT systems related to financial reporting 
·	 Prior history of fraud or error 
·	 Increased risk of override of controls, fraud or error 
·	 Constraints on the availability of capital and credit 
·	 Use of complex financing arrangements 
·	 Corporate restructurings 
·	 Significant changes in entity from Prior Period 
·	 Significant transactions with related parties 
·	 Changes in key personnel/ exit of key personnel 
·	 Weaknesses in internal control/IFCoFR qualified 
·	 Inefficient accounting systems and records 
·	 Previous year's audit report qualified  
·	 Changes in accounting policies 
·	 Rapid growth or unusual profitability especially compared to that of other companies in the same industry 
·	 Any other which the auditor may consider significant 
	
Clearly Trivial: Meaning	
	
-	In  addition to the materiality levels, the auditor also determines the triviality benchmark and hence it is needed to understand
	the meaning of Clearly Trivial
	
-	Clearly Trivial: Meaning
	 These are usually matters that are:
	i) Wholly smaller than that determined in accordance with Revised SA 320. (Para 1.32 of Implementation Guide)
	ii ) are clearly inconsequential, individually or in aggregate and by any criteria. (Para 1.32 of Implementation Guide)
	
-	If there is an uncertainty whether one or more items are clearly trivial, the matter is not considered clearly trivial.
	Up to 5% of materiality is often considered as clearly trivial. (Para 1.33 of Implementation Guide)
	
-	Auditor may determine, based on the facts & circumstances of the entity in the audit engagement, that the lower level is appropriate.
	Factors affecting the threshold for Clearly Trivial Include: History of misstatement and number of locations.
	
Step 4: Documenting the choice with proper justification.	
	
-	The Auditor may consider to include following amounts & the factors considered in their determination and maintain the same as part of Audit Documentation. (Para 14 of SA 320)
	
	1) Materiality for Financial Statement as a whole. 
	2) Materiality level for:
	a) Class of Transactions 
	b) Account Balance
	c) Disclosures 
	3) Performance materiality.
	4) Include: 
	o Amount below which misstatements would be regarded as clearly trivial. 
	o All misstatements accumulated during the audit and whether they have been corrected. 
	o Auditor’s conclusion as to: - 
	i)Whether uncorrected misstatements are material, individually or in aggregate.
	ii) Basis for that conclusion.
	
	5) Any revision to any of above.
